# quantopian-backup

Since Quantopian decided to shut down, I am migrating the code I wrote there to here. It is a collection of trading strategies that I wrote in my free time.

Some of these are rudimentary, pre-existing strategies that I coded to simply gain experience. Others are ideas that I developed.

I heavily relied on the Pipeline API provided by Quantopian, the code will not run outside of that environment.
